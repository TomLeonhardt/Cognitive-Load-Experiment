<h1>Welcome to the "Cognitive Load Experiment"</h1>
<p>On the next page, a sequence of numbers will be displayed. Please memorize the sequence within the given time.</p>

<p>You will then need to keep this sequence in mind while working on a task. After completing the task, you will be asked to recall and write down the sequence of numbers.</p>

<p>This experiment consists of three rounds. In each round, you will memorize a new sequence of numbers and then complete an economic task. Each round follows the same structure, but the tasks may vary to test different aspects of cognitive load.</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>Remember, you are allowed to use AI during the tasks. You can choose to either use AI for assistance or solve the tasks independently.</p>

<br>
<p>You will have 20 seconds to memorize the numbers.</p>
