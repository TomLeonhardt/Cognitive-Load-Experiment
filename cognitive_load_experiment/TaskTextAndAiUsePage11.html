<h2>Introduction to Industrial Economics</h2>
<p>
  Industrial economics focuses on the structure, behavior, and performance of industries and markets. It examines how firms operate in different sectors, how markets are structured, and how this influences competitive dynamics. Key topics include barriers to entry, pricing, product differentiation, and market regulation. Companies aim to gain competitive advantages by driving innovation, reducing costs, and strengthening their market position. Governments play a crucial role by implementing regulations to promote competition and prevent monopolies.
