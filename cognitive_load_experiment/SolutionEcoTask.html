<h2>Prisoner's Dilemma - Solution</h2>

<p id="result-message"></p>

<p>You selected: {{ player.answer }}</p>
<p>Correct answer: A</p>

<p><strong> Here is the solution to the task:</strong></p>

<p><u>Determining the Nash Equilibrium:</u></p>

<p> Company A invests in advertising, Company B does not: (10, 1)</p>
<p> Company A does not invest in advertising, Company B invests: (1, 10)</p>
<p> If both companies choose the best response to the other company's decision, both will invest in advertising because it is their individually best response, regardless of the other company's decision.</p>

<p>Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is: <span style="color: green;">Both companies invest in advertising: (4, 4)</span>.</p>

<p><u>Strategy Decision:</u></p>

<p> As the manager of Company A, you would choose to invest in advertising because it is the best response to the possible decision of Company B and leads to the Nash equilibrium.</p>
