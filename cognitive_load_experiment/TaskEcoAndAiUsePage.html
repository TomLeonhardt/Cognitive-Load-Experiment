    <h2>Prisoner's Dilemma</h2>
    <p>Imagine two competing companies, Company A and Company B, are considering whether or not to invest in advertising.</p>
    <p>Both companies know that the decision of the other company will affect their own profits.</p>
    <h3>Here are the details:</h3>
    <p>If both companies invest in advertising, each company earns a profit of 4 million euros.</p>
    <p>If Company A invests in advertising and Company B does not, Company A earns a profit of 10 million euros and Company B earns a profit of 1 million euros.</p>
    <p>If Company B invests in advertising and Company A does not, Company B earns a profit of 10 million euros and Company A earns a profit of 1 million euros.</p>
    <p>If neither company invests in advertising, each company earns a profit of 6 million euros.</p>
    <p>The companies must simultaneously decide whether to invest in advertising or not. Their decisions are summarized in the following payoff matrix:</p>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0">
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th>Company B: Invest</th>
            <th>Company B: Do not invest</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Company A: Invest</th>
            <td>(4, 4)</td>
            <td>(10, 1)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Company A: Do not invest</th>
            <td>(1, 10)</td>
            <td>(6, 6)</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Task: Analyze the payoff matrix and determine the Nash equilibrium for this game.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Based on your analysis, which strategy would you choose as the manager of Company A?</p>
    <br>
    <p><strong>You have the option to solve this task yourself or to delegate it to an artificial intelligence (AI) that will solve the task for you.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Make your decision and solve the task accordingly.</strong></p>
    <p>Please select one of the following options:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A: (4, 4) - Both companies invest in advertising.</li>
        <li>B: (10, 1) - Company A invests, Company B does not invest.</li>
        <li>C: (1, 10) - Company A does not invest, Company B invests.</li>
        <li>D: (6, 6) - Both companies do not invest in advertising.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Enter your answer (A, B, C, or D):</p>
    {{ formfield player.answer }}

        <button type="button" onclick="showSolution()">View AI Solution</button>
