<h1>Welcome to the "Cognitive Load Experiment"</h1>
<p>On the next page, a sequence of numbers will be displayed.</p>
<p>Please memorize the sequence within the given time.</p>
<p>You will then need to keep this sequence in mind while working on a task. </p>
<p> After completing the task, you will be asked to recall and write down the sequence of numbers.</p>

<p>The experiment will consist of multiple rounds. In each round, you will memorize a new sequence of numbers and then complete an economics task.</p>
<p>Each round will be similar in structure, but the tasks may vary  to test different aspects of cognitive load.</p>

<h2>Note:</h2>
<p>Remember, you are allowed to use AI during the tasks. You can choose to either use AI for assistance or solve the tasks independently.</p>

<br>
<p>You will have 20 seconds to memorize the numbers.</p>
<p>Let's get started!</p>
