<p><strong style="font-size: 1.5em;">Thank you for participating!</strong></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>In this experiment, we explored the concept of cognitive load, its impact on decision-making, and the difficulty of solving tasks without mistakes.</p>

<h2>What is Cognitive Load Theory?</h2>
<p>Cognitive Load Theory explains how our cognitive resources are used when performing tasks. It includes three main components:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Intrinsic Load:</strong> The natural difficulty of the task itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Extraneous Load:</strong> The mental load caused by how the information is presented.</li>
  <li><strong>Germane Load:</strong> The mental effort used to process information and build knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>High cognitive load can weaken decision-making processes, leading to errors and suboptimal choices.</p>

<h2>Role of AI in Reducing Cognitive Load</h2>
<p>AI can assist in reducing cognitive load by handling complex problems, providing recommendations, and automating routine tasks. This can help individuals make better decisions by offloading some of the cognitive burden.</p>
<p>By honestly reporting whether you used AI, you help us understand its effectiveness in reducing cognitive load and improving performance.</p>
<p>It allows us to analyze the true impact of AI on cognitive load and decision-making processes.</p>

<br>

<p>I hope this experiment has provided valuable insights into the effects of cognitive load and highlighted the potential benefits of AI assistance.</p>
